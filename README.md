# LoopMixer

The LoopMixer library allows you to easily mix audio loops together in
[Processing http://processing.org/] (Java),
using [Minim http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/].
It takes care of slowing down/speeding up the loops to match the global rhythm,
which can be changed at runtime.

The library was made in 2010 to be used by the students of course TI1100-A
at the Delft University of Technology.
